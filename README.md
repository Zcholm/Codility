# Codility


This is a repository for my solutions for the lessons on codility.com
The code is written in a mixed effort to pass the tests with full scores. There are some examples of code that absolutely could be written in a more generic or nicer way, but I do consider the possible inputs for the challenge and do not in general write the code for a more generic case of inputs than what is stated in the task.
